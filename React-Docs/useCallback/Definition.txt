useCallback is a react hook that lets you cache a function definition between re-renders

const catchedFn = useCallback(fn,dependencies)

Usage : Skipping the component for re-renders
        Updating the state from memiozed callback

UseCallback hook returns a memoized callback function

the useCallback hook runs only when one of its dependencies update

the major difference between the useCallback and useMemo :
useCallback returns the memoized function
useMemo returns the memoized value
